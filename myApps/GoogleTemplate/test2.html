    <h2 id="section1">Building the Environment</h2>
    <p>
      To start, ensure you have the necessary tools installed. You can use
      <code>ffmpeg</code>, <code>avifenc</code>, or other tools of your choice.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
# Example command to install dependencies:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg libavif-tools
    </code></pre>
    
    <h2 id="section2">Creating the Animated AVIF</h2>
    <p>
      Use <code>avifenc</code> or <code>ffmpeg</code> to compress images into an
      animated AVIF. The commands might look like this:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
# Using ffmpeg
ffmpeg -i input_%02d.png -c:v libaom-av1 -pix_fmt yuv420p10le output.avif
    </code></pre>
    
    <h2 id="section3">Rendering the Page</h2>
    <p>
      To display your animated AVIF in a webpage, simply use the
      <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag or consider a
      <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> tag for broader support:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
&lt;picture&gt;
  &lt;source srcset="animation.avif" type="image/avif" /&gt;
  &lt;img src="fallback.png" alt="Animated example" /&gt;
&lt;/picture&gt;
    </code></pre>
    
    <h2 id="section4">Final Steps</h2>
    <p>
      Once you have your page ready, upload it to a server or open it locally in
      your browser to test. Make sure your browser supports AVIF to see the
      animation.
